This application is for our UAE based client, the main purpose of the application is to give users a platform to book/reserve the tickets of events in their area and their selected category.
The main work i did in this application is to develop a complete backend for both iOS/Android mobile apps and Website admin section in NodeJS and deploy it on NGINX server on client's VPS.
The backend also have features, like adding event, deleting event, uploading multiple images in base64 format using gridfs module of node and very importantly, a custom algorithm developeby me for recurring events.
This application concept is made for mobile applications (ios/android) and using web panel for users/events management and notifications.
